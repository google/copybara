## Basic git-to-git import

This example will import Copybara source code to an internal git repository
under ``$GIT/third_party/copybara``.

Assuming you have an existing git repository. For the example in ``/tmp/foo``. But it could be
a remote one:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/foo
cd /tmp/foo
git init --bare .
```

Create a ``copy.bara.sky`` config file like:

```python
url = "https://github.com/google/copybara.git"

core.workflow(
    name = "default",
    origin = git.origin(
        url = url,
        ref = "master",
    ),
    destination = git.destination(
        url = "file:///tmp/foo",
        fetch = "master",
        push = "master",
    ),
    # Copy everything but don't remove a README_INTERNAL.txt file if it exists.
    destination_files = glob(["third_party/copybara/**"], exclude = ["README_INTERNAL.txt"]),

    authoring = authoring.pass_thru("Default email <default@default.com>"),
    transformations = [
	    core.move("", "third_party/copybara"),
	],
)
```

Invoke the tool like:

```bash
copybara copy.bara.sky --force
```

``--force`` should only be needed for empty destination repositories or non-existent
branches in the destination. After the first import, it should be always invoked as:

```
copybara copy.bara.sky
```

## GitHub SSH basic import

This example will import private source code to an external GitHub repository, and uses SSH.

PROTIP: You will need to have an ssh key setup without a password to accomplish this, Copybara doesn't
currently support ssh with a password.

Create a ``copy.bara.sky`` config file like:

```python
# Update these references to your orginzations repos
sourceUrl = "git@github.com:organization/internal-repo.git"
destinationUrl = "git@github.com:organization/external-repo.git"

core.workflow(
    name = "default",
    origin = git.origin(
        url = sourceUrl,
        ref = "master",
    ),
    destination = git.destination(
        url = destinationUrl,
        fetch = "master",
        push = "master",
    ),
    # Change path to the folder you want to publish publicly
    origin_files = glob(["path/to/folder/you/want/exported/**"]),

    authoring = authoring.pass_thru("Default email <default@default.com>"),

    # Change the path here to the folder you want to publish publicly
    transformations = [
	    core.move("path/to/folder/you/want/exported", ""),
	],
)
```

Invoke the tool like:

```bash
copybara copy.bara.sky --force
```

``--force`` should only be needed for empty destination repositories or non-existent
branches in the destination. After the first import, it should be always invoked as:

```
copybara copy.bara.sky
```

After running through this example, you should see all the source from
the folder you selected in the external-repo at the root. This can be helpful if you
are only trying to move a subdirectory in your git repo out for public use.

## Transformations

Let's say that we realized that we need to do some code transformations to the imported code.
We could use core.replace to do it. Here we look for ``//third_party/bazel/bashunit`` text
and we replace it with the correct destination one just for BUILD files:


```python
url = "https://github.com/google/copybara.git"

core.workflow(
    name = "default",
    origin = git.origin(
        url = url,
        ref = "master",
    ),
    destination = git.destination(
        url = "file:///tmp/foo",
        fetch = "master",
        push = "master",
    ),

    # Copy everything but don't remove a README_INTERNAL.txt file if it exists.
    destination_files = glob(["third_party/copybara/**"], exclude = ["README_INTERNAL.txt"]),

    authoring = authoring.pass_thru("Default email <default@default.com>"),
	transformations = [
   	    core.replace(
        	before = "//third_party/bazel/bashunit",
	        after = "//another/path:bashunit",
        	paths = glob(["**/BUILD"]),
		),
        core.move("", "third_party/copybara")
    ],
)
```

### Subcommands

The tool accepts different subcommands, _Ã  la_ Bazel. If no
command is specified, *migrate* is executed by default. These two commands are
equivalent:

```shell
$ copybara copy.bara.sky
$ copybara migrate copy.bara.sky
```

You can validate your configuration running:

```shell
$ copybara validate copy.bara.sky
Copybara source mover
INFO: Configuration validated.
```

And you can get information about a migration workflow by running:

```shell
$ copybara info copy.bara.sky
Copybara source mover
...
INFO: Workflow 'default': last_migrated_ref 4dd20b2...
```
